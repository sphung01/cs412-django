            <h1>Who is Albert Einstein?</h1>
            <p>
                Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist who revolutionized physics with 
                his theory of relativity and contributions to quantum mechanics. 
                His famous equation, E = mc2, derived from special relativity, expresses the equivalence of mass and energy. 
                Einstein's work helped scientists understand the universe and how it works. 
                He also contributed to the development of cosmology, believing the universe could expand and contract.
